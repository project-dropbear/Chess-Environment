# Chess-Environment
A program that facilitates a chess game between two users on Python.
In 2019, I created a program that simulates a real-life chess game. After several losses to my friends in chess,
I was motivated to create a bot that could adapt its moves to the opponent. However, knowing that A.I. was beyond
my basic Python skills at the time, I instead built a more foundational component - a program where chess games 
could be played. Excited by this project, I quickly began coding without much planning, leading to many logic errors.
Instead of spending hours debugging and rewriting code as I did initially, I began coding at a more abstract level. 
For example, instead of separate code for black and white players, I used the symmetry between their pieces to generalise 
the code for any player. To further reduce errors and maintain order, I frequently commented on my code and created files
for different aspects of the game including a sandbox used to isolate and test certain functions. This made executing new
ideas easier as I could visualise the way input was processed into output. I could translate the game's rules into code and
allow players to move pieces by simply inputting its initial and final positions. After a month of progress, I successfully
built a program that allows chess to be played between people.
